# 🔒 Admin Panel Access

## New Admin URL

The admin panel has been moved to a hidden path for security:

**New URL:** `https://sibramlandingpage.netlify.app/a7f3k9m2p/`

**For Production:** `https://sibelibram.ro/a7f3k9m2p/`

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Bookmark this URL immediately** - The path is intentionally hard to remember
2. **Do not share this URL** - Keep it private
3. **The old `/admin/` path no longer works** - All references have been updated
4. **Firebase authentication is still required** - This is just an additional layer of obscurity

---

## 📝 What Changed

- Admin folder renamed from `admin/` to `a7f3k9m2p/`
- All script references updated (index.html, detail pages)
- Netlify redirects updated in `_redirects` file
- Firebase config path updated in all pages

---

## 🔐 Security

This change provides **security through obscurity** - the admin page is now at a random path that's hard to guess. However, remember:

- ✅ **Firebase authentication is still your real security** - Strong password required
- ✅ **This just makes it harder to find** - Not a replacement for proper authentication
- ✅ **Consider changing the path periodically** - Every 6-12 months for extra security

   - `publication-detail.html`
   - `speaking-detail.html`
