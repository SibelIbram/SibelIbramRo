## Image Recommendations:
- Use high-quality images (at least 1200px width for large images)
- Optimize images for web (use JPG for photos, PNG for logos)
- Maintain consistent aspect ratios for similar image types
- Use descriptive filenames

For now, you can use placeholder images or your own photos. The website will work even if some images are missing (they just won't display).
