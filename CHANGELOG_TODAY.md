# Today's Changes and Enhancements

**Date:** 2026-01-02

## Fixes
- **Speaking Section Image Display**: Fixed image aspect ratio issue in Speaking posts. Images now maintain their original aspect ratio with fixed width and variable height, preventing excessive cropping and enlargement. Changed from `object-fit: cover` with variable height to `object-fit: contain` with auto height.
- **Speaking Post Edit Bug**: Fixed bug where short description and full description fields were not appearing when editing existing Speaking posts. Both fields now properly load and save when using the inline edit form.
- **Navigation Hash Fragment Bug**: Fixed bug where clicking "Back to Trainings" or "Back to Publications" from detail pages would redirect to the About Me/home page instead of the correct section. The navigation now properly handles hash fragments (#trainings, #publications, etc.) on page load and correctly switches to the appropriate section. Also eliminated the flicker where the home page would briefly appear before switching to the target section by checking the hash immediately on page load and setting the correct initial state before any content renders.
- **Browser Back Button Navigation Fix**: Fixed issue where using the browser's back button (or mouse back button) from a detail page would return to the About Me/home page instead of the previous section (e.g., Trainings or Publications). The system now uses sessionStorage to remember the last visited section and automatically restores it when returning from detail pages via the back button.
- **Romanian Translation Fix**: Fixed missing Romanian translations for "Read More" buttons and "Back to..." links. Added translations for "trainings-read-more" (Citește mai mult →), "back-to-trainings" (← Înapoi la Formări), "back-to-publications" (← Înapoi la Publicații), and "back-to-speaking" (← Înapoi la Prezentări). All detail pages now properly display Romanian text when the language is set to Romanian. Fixed issue where translations weren't being applied on detail pages by ensuring translation runs even when language buttons are not present on the page. Fixed "Read More" buttons showing English text by moving the translations object and getTranslation() function to global scope (available immediately when script.js loads) so they can be accessed by content-loader.js when dynamically generating content. This ensures "Read More" buttons display in the correct language (Romanian or English) based on user preference.
- **Detail Page Header Cleanup**: Removed non-functional "Back to..." navigation buttons from detail page headers (training-detail.html, publication-detail.html, speaking-detail.html). The functional "Back to..." links remain in the content area below the header.
- **URL Hash Stuck After Back Navigation**: Fixed bug where the browser address bar would get "stuck" with a hash fragment (e.g., `/#speaking`) after using the browser back button from a detail page, even when the user originally opened the site at the root URL (no hash). The system now tracks whether the user explicitly navigated to a section (had a hash) using a `hadHash` flag in sessionStorage. When returning from a detail page: if the user had explicitly navigated to a section, the hash is restored; if the user started at the root URL (no hash), they return to the clean root URL without any hash fragment. This ensures the URL correctly reflects the user's navigation state.
- **Footer Layout Inconsistency on Detail Pages**: Fixed footer layout inconsistency where detail pages (speaking-detail.html, training-detail.html, publication-detail.html) displayed a different footer structure compared to the main page. All detail pages now have the same footer layout as the main page, including: Quick Links section, Connect section, Legal section (Privacy Policy and Terms of Service links), and Copyright section. The footer structure, styling, and content are now consistent across all pages.
- **Footer Layout Inconsistency on Legal Pages**: Fixed footer layout inconsistency where legal pages (privacy-policy.html, terms-of-service.html) were missing the "Connect" section. Both legal pages now have the complete footer structure matching the main page: Quick Links section, Connect section (LinkedIn and Email links), Legal section, and Copyright section. The footer is now consistent across all pages including legal pages in both English and Romanian.

## Enhancements
- **Website Title and Favicon**: Updated all HTML pages (index.html, training-detail.html, publication-detail.html, speaking-detail.html, admin/index.html) to display "sibelibram.ro" as the browser tab title. Added favicon (S_favicon.ico) to all pages so the website now displays a custom icon in browser tabs instead of the default generic icon.
- **Speaking Posts "Read More" Feature**: Added "Read More" functionality for Speaking posts. On the main page, descriptions are now hidden, and if a description exists, a "Read More" button appears that links to a dedicated detail page. The detail page displays the image at the top (full width, variable height maintaining aspect ratio), followed by the title, location, date, full description, and links. This provides a cleaner main page view while allowing detailed information to be accessed when needed.

## Updates
- **Speaking Detail Page Layout**: Updated the layout of Speaking detail pages. The image is now positioned on the right half of the page, with the title, location, date, and links on the left half. The description appears below in full width, creating a more balanced and visually appealing layout.
- **Automatic URL Linking**: Added automatic URL detection and conversion in Speaking detail page descriptions. Any URLs (http:// or https://) found in the description text are automatically converted to clickable hyperlinks, even if the user didn't format them as links in the editor. This ensures all web links are accessible without requiring manual formatting.
- **Short Description Field for Speaking Posts**: Added a "Short Description" field for Speaking posts. This short description appears on the main page to give users a preview of the content. The full description only appears on the "Read More" detail page. The admin tool now includes both fields: "Short Description" (optional, for main page) and "Full Description" (required, for detail page). This allows for better content organization and a cleaner main page display.
- **DOCX Upload Support for Speaking Full Description**: Added .docx file upload support for the Speaking Full Description field in the admin tool. Users can now upload a .docx file which will be automatically converted to formatted text and inserted into the Full Description field, matching the functionality available for Training and Publication content fields.
- **About Me / Despre mine Content Update**: Updated the "About Me" section content for both English and Romanian versions using content from DOCX files (Aboutme_EN.docx and Despre_mine_RO.docx). The content has been refreshed with updated text, including refined descriptions of specializations, purpose, and collaboration areas. Removed outdated paragraphs and list items that are no longer relevant. The new content better reflects the current professional focus and services offered.
- **Legal Pages (Privacy Policy & Terms of Service)**: Created dedicated legal pages for Privacy Policy and Terms of Service in both English and Romanian. Content was extracted from DOCX files (Confidentialitypolicy.docx, TermsAndCond_EN.docx, Politica_Globală_de_Confidențialitate.docx, TermsRO.docx) and integrated into two new HTML pages (privacy-policy.html and terms-of-service.html). Both pages support language switching (EN/RO) and maintain the same header/footer structure as the main site. Footer links on the main page now point to these legal pages. Added translations for "Back to Home" navigation link in both languages.
- **Copyright Year Update**: Updated copyright year from 2025 to 2026 in all footer instances across all pages (main page, detail pages, legal pages) and in both languages (English and Romanian). The copyright notice now displays "© 2026 Sibel Ibram. All rights reserved." in English and "© 2026 Sibel Ibram. Toate drepturile rezervate." in Romanian.
- **Romanian Translation Update - Trainings Section**: Changed the Romanian translation for "Trainings" from "Formări" to "Training" across all locations including navigation buttons, section titles, and "Back to Trainings" links. This change applies to all pages (main page, detail pages, footer links) when the language is set to Romanian.

## Enhancements
- **Speaking Posts Date Field Enhancement**: Replaced the text input for the "Date" field in Speaking posts with a date picker (date input controller) similar to Publications. The date is now stored in YYYY-MM-DD format and displayed on the website in European format (dd/mm/yyyy). Updated both the admin panel (new post form and inline edit form) and all website display locations (main page list, detail pages). For existing posts with string dates, the system automatically replaces them with a default date (today's date) when editing, ensuring all posts use the new date format going forward.
- **Admin Page Security - Hidden Path**: Renamed the admin folder from `admin` to `a7f3k9m2p` to make the admin page harder to discover. The admin panel is now accessible at `/a7f3k9m2p/` instead of `/admin/`. Updated all references in the codebase (index.html, detail pages, _redirects file) to use the new path. This provides security through obscurity - the admin page is no longer at an easily guessable path. **Important:** Bookmark the new URL: `https://sibramlandingpage.netlify.app/a7f3k9m2p/` (or your production domain + `/a7f3k9m2p/`)
