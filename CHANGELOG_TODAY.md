# Today's Changes and Enhancements

**Date:** 2026-01-02

## Fixes
- **Speaking Section Image Display**: Fixed image aspect ratio issue in Speaking posts. Images now maintain their original aspect ratio with fixed width and variable height, preventing excessive cropping and enlargement. Changed from `object-fit: cover` with variable height to `object-fit: contain` with auto height.
- **Speaking Post Edit Bug**: Fixed bug where short description and full description fields were not appearing when editing existing Speaking posts. Both fields now properly load and save when using the inline edit form.
- **Navigation Hash Fragment Bug**: Fixed bug where clicking "Back to Trainings" or "Back to Publications" from detail pages would redirect to the About Me/home page instead of the correct section. The navigation now properly handles hash fragments (#trainings, #publications, etc.) on page load and correctly switches to the appropriate section. Also eliminated the flicker where the home page would briefly appear before switching to the target section by checking the hash immediately on page load and setting the correct initial state before any content renders.
- **Browser Back Button Navigation Fix**: Fixed issue where using the browser's back button (or mouse back button) from a detail page would return to the About Me/home page instead of the previous section (e.g., Trainings or Publications). The system now uses sessionStorage to remember the last visited section and automatically restores it when returning from detail pages via the back button.
- **Romanian Translation Fix**: Fixed missing Romanian translations for "Read More" buttons and "Back to..." links. Added translations for "trainings-read-more" (Citește mai mult →), "back-to-trainings" (← Înapoi la Formări), "back-to-publications" (← Înapoi la Publicații), and "back-to-speaking" (← Înapoi la Prezentări). All detail pages now properly display Romanian text when the language is set to Romanian. Fixed issue where translations weren't being applied on detail pages by ensuring translation runs even when language buttons are not present on the page. Fixed "Read More" buttons showing English text by moving the translations object and getTranslation() function to global scope (available immediately when script.js loads) so they can be accessed by content-loader.js when dynamically generating content. This ensures "Read More" buttons display in the correct language (Romanian or English) based on user preference.
- **Detail Page Header Cleanup**: Removed non-functional "Back to..." navigation buttons from detail page headers (training-detail.html, publication-detail.html, speaking-detail.html). The functional "Back to..." links remain in the content area below the header.

## Enhancements
- **Website Title and Favicon**: Updated all HTML pages (index.html, training-detail.html, publication-detail.html, speaking-detail.html, admin/index.html) to display "sibelibram.ro" as the browser tab title. Added favicon (S_favicon.ico) to all pages so the website now displays a custom icon in browser tabs instead of the default generic icon.
- **Speaking Posts "Read More" Feature**: Added "Read More" functionality for Speaking posts. On the main page, descriptions are now hidden, and if a description exists, a "Read More" button appears that links to a dedicated detail page. The detail page displays the image at the top (full width, variable height maintaining aspect ratio), followed by the title, location, date, full description, and links. This provides a cleaner main page view while allowing detailed information to be accessed when needed.

## Updates
- **Speaking Detail Page Layout**: Updated the layout of Speaking detail pages. The image is now positioned on the right half of the page, with the title, location, date, and links on the left half. The description appears below in full width, creating a more balanced and visually appealing layout.
- **Automatic URL Linking**: Added automatic URL detection and conversion in Speaking detail page descriptions. Any URLs (http:// or https://) found in the description text are automatically converted to clickable hyperlinks, even if the user didn't format them as links in the editor. This ensures all web links are accessible without requiring manual formatting.
- **Short Description Field for Speaking Posts**: Added a "Short Description" field for Speaking posts. This short description appears on the main page to give users a preview of the content. The full description only appears on the "Read More" detail page. The admin tool now includes both fields: "Short Description" (optional, for main page) and "Full Description" (required, for detail page). This allows for better content organization and a cleaner main page display.
- **DOCX Upload Support for Speaking Full Description**: Added .docx file upload support for the Speaking Full Description field in the admin tool. Users can now upload a .docx file which will be automatically converted to formatted text and inserted into the Full Description field, matching the functionality available for Training and Publication content fields.
- **About Me / Despre mine Content Update**: Updated the "About Me" section content for both English and Romanian versions using content from DOCX files (Aboutme_EN.docx and Despre_mine_RO.docx). The content has been refreshed with updated text, including refined descriptions of specializations, purpose, and collaboration areas. Removed outdated paragraphs and list items that are no longer relevant. The new content better reflects the current professional focus and services offered.
- **Legal Pages (Privacy Policy & Terms of Service)**: Created dedicated legal pages for Privacy Policy and Terms of Service in both English and Romanian. Content was extracted from DOCX files (Confidentialitypolicy.docx, TermsAndCond_EN.docx, Politica_Globală_de_Confidențialitate.docx, TermsRO.docx) and integrated into two new HTML pages (privacy-policy.html and terms-of-service.html). Both pages support language switching (EN/RO) and maintain the same header/footer structure as the main site. Footer links on the main page now point to these legal pages. Added translations for "Back to Home" navigation link in both languages.
